                    <h2>MY STORY</h2>
                    <p> Photography came to me at a time when i need it most -
                        it was like walking right into what i was created to do , only i had no
                        freakin' idea that's what i was heading into . It fit me , my personality , my strengths. It had me 
                        constantly thinking , changing , growing and it makes me  
                    feel alive to know that tomorrow will never be the same 
                as today.I firmly believe each person was created to
            use their specific abilities and passion to bless other, no matter the industry , i am certain 
        this is mine. I went after it full steam , no question asked, not a shred of a doubt. it's who i am ,feed me.                   </p>
